# xAPI Specification Knowledge Base

Provide comprehensive guidance on xAPI (Experience API) specification for educational assessment and learning analytics.

## Core Concepts

### Statement Structure

An xAPI Statement follows the "Actor-Verb-Object" pattern with optional Result and Context:

```json
{
  "actor": { },      // Who performed the action
  "verb": { },       // What action was performed
  "object": { },     // What was acted upon
  "result": { },     // Outcome of the action (optional)
  "context": { },    // Additional context (optional)
  "timestamp": "",   // When the action occurred
  "id": ""           // Unique statement identifier (UUID)
}
```

### Required Fields

1. **Actor** - Agent or Group performing the action
2. **Verb** - Action taken (URI + display name)
3. **Object** - Activity, Agent, or Statement Reference

### Actor Types

**Agent** (single learner):
```json
{
  "objectType": "Agent",
  "name": "Learner Name",
  "mbox": "mailto:learner@example.com"
}
```

**Account-based identification** (recommended for LMS):
```json
{
  "objectType": "Agent",
  "account": {
    "homePage": "https://lms.example.com",
    "name": "user123"
  }
}
```

### Verb Structure

Define verbs with URI identifier and display text:

```json
{
  "id": "http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/answered",
  "display": {
    "en-US": "answered"
  }
}
```

Consult `references/verbs.md` for the complete ADL and cmi5 verb registry.

### Object (Activity) Structure

```json
{
  "objectType": "Activity",
  "id": "https://example.com/activities/quiz-123",
  "definition": {
    "name": { "en-US": "Quiz on xAPI Basics" },
    "description": { "en-US": "A quiz testing knowledge of xAPI" },
    "type": "http://adlnet.gov/expapi/activities/assessment"
  }
}
```

### Result Structure

Capture assessment outcomes:

```json
{
  "score": {
    "scaled": 0.85,
    "raw": 85,
    "min": 0,
    "max": 100
  },
  "success": true,
  "completion": true,
  "response": "choice-a",
  "duration": "PT30S"
}
```

**Duration format**: ISO 8601 duration (PT = Period Time, e.g., PT1H30M = 1 hour 30 minutes)

### Context Structure

Provide additional information about the learning experience:

```json
{
  "registration": "uuid-for-attempt",
  "contextActivities": {
    "parent": [{ "id": "https://example.com/course-123" }],
    "grouping": [{ "id": "https://example.com/program-abc" }],
    "category": [{ "id": "https://w3id.org/xapi/cmi5/context/categories/cmi5" }]
  },
  "platform": "Example LMS",
  "language": "en-US"
}
```

## Interaction Types for Assessments

xAPI supports these interaction types for quiz questions:

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `true-false` | Binary choice | Yes/No, True/False questions |
| `choice` | Multiple choice | Single or multiple selection |
| `fill-in` | Text input | Short answer questions |
| `long-fill-in` | Long text | Essay questions |
| `matching` | Pair matching | Match items from two lists |
| `performance` | Task steps | Procedural tasks |
| `sequencing` | Order items | Arrange in correct sequence |
| `likert` | Scale rating | Survey/opinion questions |
| `numeric` | Number input | Mathematical answers |

Consult `references/interaction-types.md` for detailed examples of each type.

## Activity Types

Common activity types for educational contexts:

| Category | Type URI | Use Case |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Assessment | `http://adlnet.gov/expapi/activities/assessment` | Quizzes, exams |
| Question | `http://adlnet.gov/expapi/activities/cmi.interaction` | Individual questions |
| Course | `http://adlnet.gov/expapi/activities/course` | Course container |
| Module | `http://adlnet.gov/expapi/activities/module` | Course sections |
| Lesson | `http://adlnet.gov/expapi/activities/lesson` | Individual lessons |

Consult `references/activity-types.md` for the complete registry.

## cmi5 Profile

cmi5 is a standardized xAPI profile for e-learning. Key requirements:

1. **Defined verbs**: launched, initialized, completed, passed, failed, abandoned, waived, terminated
2. **Mandatory context**: registration, sessionId, masteryScore
3. **Required extensions**: sessionId, launchMode, launchURL

For cmi5-compliant statements, consult `references/cmi5-profile.md`.

## Statement Generation Workflow

To generate a valid xAPI statement:

1. Identify the **Actor** (learner/user information)
2. Select appropriate **Verb** from ADL registry
3. Define the **Object** (activity being tracked)
4. Include **Result** for assessment outcomes
5. Add **Context** for hierarchical relationships
6. Generate **UUID** for statement ID
7. Add **timestamp** in ISO 8601 format

## Validation Checklist

Validate statements against these criteria:

**Structural validation:**
- [ ] Actor has valid identifier (mbox, account, or openid)
- [ ] Verb has id (URI) and display (language map)
- [ ] Object has id and objectType

**Vocabulary validation:**
- [ ] Verb URI matches ADL/cmi5 registry
- [ ] Activity type URI is valid

**cmi5 validation:**
- [ ] Context includes registration UUID
- [ ] Context includes sessionId extension
- [ ] Correct verb sequence (launched → initialized → ... → terminated)

**Interaction validation:**
- [ ] interactionType matches response format
- [ ] correctResponsesPattern format matches interactionType
- [ ] choices/scale/source/target arrays are valid for type
